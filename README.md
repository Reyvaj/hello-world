A simple exercise to learn the basics of GitHub.

My name is Javier Ortiz. I work as a middleschool/highschool teacher. I'm passionate about education and learning. This passion has led me to discover the crucial role that technology is playing in shaping our reality. For the past two years I've commited myself to learning computer programming, data science and artificial intelligence. 

Last year I obtained a certification as a Microsoft Technology Associate. I continued taking some courses in computer scince unitl later that year when I enrolled in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. Last month I graduated from the program and I'm currently working to make my portfolio avialable to potential employers in order to obtain a position as an entry level data analyst.
